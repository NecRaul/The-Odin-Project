# The Odin Project

~~Finally going through The Odin Project seriously (for real this time).~~

Finished the Foundations path.

## Opinions

Positive: Makes you set up your environment and teaches you a bit about git/version control.

Negative: Sends you off to other sites to read or watch things about web development instead of doing web development.

## Final verdict

It's probably a good for someone who has never coded in his life. Sucks for someone who has done coding (or someone who's familiar with CS concepts) but not front-end stuff.
